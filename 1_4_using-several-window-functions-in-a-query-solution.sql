# Using Several Window Functions in a Query - Solution

# Solution #1:

SELECT

dm.emp_no,

    salary,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_no ORDER BY salary ASC) AS row_num1,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_no ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num2   

FROM

dept_manager dm

    JOIN 

    salaries s ON dm.emp_no = s.emp_no;



# Solution #2:

SELECT

dm.emp_no,

    salary,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS row_num1,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_no ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num2

FROM

dept_manager dm

    JOIN 

    salaries s ON dm.emp_no = s.emp_no

ORDER BY row_num1, emp_no, salary ASC;
