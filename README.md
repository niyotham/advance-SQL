## Exercises

### Exercise #1 :

Write a query that upon execution, assigns a row number to all managers we have information for in the "employees" database (regardless of their department).

Let the numbering disregard the department the managers have worked in. Also, let it start from the value of 1. Assign that value to the manager with the lowest employee number.
